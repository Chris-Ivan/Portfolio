<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
<h3><a href="https://chris-ivan.studio">www.chris-ivan.studio</a></h3>

As someone interested in both Web Development and UI/UX, I think having a personal portfolio website is crucial. This website can also be used to show my skillset in front of prospective clients. When developing this website, I want to create a cool-looking website with some fancy animations, which I implemented using Framer Motion. I also learned how to use Sanity.io CMS to manage my project contents and Google Analytics to analyze visitor behaviors.

Currently, this website is hosted using Netlify to serve the React frontend and Heroku for the NodeJS backend. In the future, I will probably deploy this website on a VPS to learn CI/CD with Github Actions and Docker. In the meantime, I will try to upgrade the UI using some 3D creations (they are cool :D) and more animations.
